# Viral Game Mechanics and Monetization Research

## Viral Game Mechanics

### Key Virality Features for Games

1. **Easy Sharing Mechanism**
   - Make sharing part of the core game loop
   - Ensure sharing buttons are prominently visible
   - Don't hide invite mechanisms in menus or settings
   - Provide multiple social media platforms for sharing
   - Offer rewards for sharing (with clear benefits explained)

2. **Strategic Timing for Sharing Prompts**
   - Prompt sharing during "WOW moments" (after completing levels, achieving high scores)
   - Ask for referrals when users are at high-satisfaction points
   - Use these moments to also encourage app ratings and reviews
   - Example: Doomsday Clicker shows "Show the world your chaos" popup after achievements

3. **Multiple Sharing Methods**
   - Native sharing
   - Unique codes
   - Social media integration
   - Leaderboards that encourage competition

4. **In-built Analytics**
   - Track where users engage most
   - Identify high-satisfaction moments
   - Use data to optimize placement of sharing prompts

5. **Ongoing Optimization**
   - Test different sharing messages and visuals
   - Experiment with different rewards
   - Monitor conversion rates and adjust accordingly

## Monetization Strategies

### @levelsio's Advertising Approach

Based on research of Pieter Levels (@levelsio) and his successful projects:

1. **Limited Ad Slots**
   - Sells a fixed number of ad slots (example: 6 slots)
   - Once filled, no more ads are accepted until slots open up
   - This creates scarcity and prevents overloading the game with ads
   - Example quote: "I'm still selling ad slots but I'll be limiting them now so the game doesn't get overloaded with ads"

2. **Direct Sponsorship Model**
   - Advertisers pay directly for placement
   - Some sponsors reportedly paid up to $5,000/month
   - Uses a simple payment system (example: Stripe)
   - Transparent pricing model

3. **Building in Public**
   - Shares development process openly
   - Creates buzz and anticipation
   - Attracts both users and potential advertisers
   - Builds community around the product

4. **Rapid Development and Iteration**
   - "Shotgun strategy" - developing multiple products/features rapidly
   - Let the market decide what works
   - Focus on shipping quickly rather than perfection
   - Iterate based on user feedback
